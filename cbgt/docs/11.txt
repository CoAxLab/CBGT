# Compilation and Execution

Prior to execution, the test directory must contain both network.conf and network.pro files for the configuration/protocol of the simulation. The .conf file lists out parameters of the network (neural population names, size, and connectivity), while the .pro file is a list of special simulation events (such as the EndTrial event).   


  


Compilation is performed using the command

gcc -o [path to testdir]/bgModel BG_inh_pathway.c rando2.h -lm  


  


Uses gcc compiler which is available on pretty much any *nix system  


The argument -o [path to testdir]/bgModel is specifying the name of the destination executable  


The arguments BG_inh_pathway.c rando2.h are the source file and header  


The argument -lm is needed to link the math library  


  


The execute the program, you can first navigate to the test directory with  


cd [path to testdir]

And then execute with  


./bgModel [opts...]  


Where [opts...] is a list of options (each separated by spaces). If you just want spike train data (spikes per unit time) for each neural population, no options are needed.

  


List of options:  


-h Outputs usage information describing these options

-v Turns on verbose mode (flagverbose=1)

-t#ï»¿ Where # is a number, sets the number of saved traces per population. By default, this value is 0 (NumberofTraces=0)

-ns Spikes and traces are not saved, only mean frequencies (FlagSaveAllSpikes=0; NumberofTraces=0)  


-s# Sets the seed for random number generation. By default, the seed is 1000.

-n# Sets the current trial number. By default is set to 0 (Trialnumber=0)

  


The program outputs several files (see other notes for details):  


popfreq#.dat : population mean frequencies over time  


poptraces#.dat : traces for selected individual neurons in each population  


pop#_#.dat : complete spike information for a given population  


  


All times are in milliseconds, all frequencies are in Hertz, and all voltages are in millivolts.
