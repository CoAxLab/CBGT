# Short-term depression and short-term facilitation

Although only the equation for STD is shown in the paper, the program also includes code for STF, (which works identically except the change of sign?). See equation 7 from the paper. The variable D represents a multiplier on the synaptic current for that particular projection.  


  


Decay over time:  


dx/dt = (1 - x) / tau  


When a spike is received:  


x += -p*x  


  


Variables for STD:  


x .D  


tau .tauD (= 1000)  


p .pv (= 0)  


Variables for STF:  


x .F  


tau .tauF (= 5000)  


p .Fp (= 0)  


  


The values of tau and p for each type and each connection can be specified in the network.conf file within their target declarations. Since p=0 by default, STD and STF are off by default.
